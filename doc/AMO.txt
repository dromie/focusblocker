Brief Summary:
Block websites for a given time to help you focus on work/study (currently blocks facebook, twitter, feedly and icanhazcheezeburger.)

Detailed description:
FocusBlocker is a light-weight add-on that blocks time-wasting websites to help you focus on real work. By clicking the icon, a selected list of websites will be blocked for a given time (say 30 min). Also, a soft reminder will pop-up when you browse those websites for too long. FocusBlocker can give you flexible control over when you want to block, which is superior than a schedule-based approach is you have a flexible working schedule.

The blocking time and reminder pop-up time can be adjusted in the add-on preference page.

The list of blocking website includes some common time-wasters:
* facebook
* twitter
* feedly
* icanhazcheezeburger
Setting your own custom list will be supported soon.
